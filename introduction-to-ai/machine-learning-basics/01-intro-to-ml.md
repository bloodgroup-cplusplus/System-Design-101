# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data," to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Learns from labeled training data
- Makes predictions based on input-output pairs
- Examples: Classification, Regression

**Common Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Learns from unlabeled data
- Finds hidden patterns or structures
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

**Common Algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Receives rewards or penalties
- Examples: Game playing, Robotics

**Key Concepts:**
- Agent
- Environment
- State
- Action
- Reward

## The Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data for your problem
2. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Select and create relevant features
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithm(s)
5. **Training**: Fit the model to training data
6. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance
7. **Deployment**: Put model into production
8. **Monitoring**: Track performance and retrain as needed

## Key Concepts

### Training and Testing
- **Training Set**: Data used to train the model
- **Validation Set**: Data used to tune hyperparameters
- **Test Set**: Data used to evaluate final model performance

### Overfitting and Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: Model learns training data too well, poor generalization
- **Underfitting**: Model too simple, doesn't capture patterns
- **Goal**: Find the right balance for good generalization

## Getting Started with ML

To begin with machine learning:

1. Learn Python and its ML libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
2. Understand basic statistics and probability
3. Practice with datasets from Kaggle or UCI ML Repository
4. Start with simple algorithms and gradually increase complexity

## Next Steps

In the upcoming topics, we'll dive deeper into specific machine learning algorithms and their applications.
