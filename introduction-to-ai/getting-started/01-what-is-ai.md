# What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

## Key Concepts

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input.

## Applications of AI

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language
- **Computer Vision**: Analyzing and understanding visual information
- **Robotics**: Creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks autonomously
- **Expert Systems**: Systems that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert

## Getting Started

To begin your journey in AI, you should:

1. Learn the fundamentals of programming (Python is recommended)
2. Understand basic mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, probability)
3. Study machine learning algorithms
4. Practice with real-world datasets

## Next Steps

In the next topic, we'll explore the different types of AI and how they're classified.
