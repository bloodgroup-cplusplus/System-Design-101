# Types of Artificial Intelligence

AI can be categorized in several ways based on capabilities and functionalities. Understanding these classifications helps in grasping the scope and limitations of different AI systems.

## Based on Capabilities

### 1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
- Designed to perform a specific task
- Most current AI systems fall into this category
- Examples: Virtual assistants, recommendation systems, image recognition

### 2. General AI (Strong AI)
- Possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across different domains
- Can perform any intellectual task that a human can
- Currently theoretical and not yet achieved

### 3. Super AI
- Surpasses human intelligence across all domains
- Purely hypothetical at this stage
- Subject of much debate in AI ethics and philosophy

## Based on Functionality

### Reactive Machines
- No memory or past experience
- Respond to current situations
- Example: IBM's Deep Blue chess computer

### Limited Memory
- Can use past experiences to inform future decisions
- Most modern AI applications fall here
- Example: Self-driving cars

### Theory of Mind
- Understand emotions, beliefs, and thought processes
- Still in research and development phase
- Would enable more natural human-AI interaction

### Self-Aware AI
- Possess consciousness and self-awareness
- Purely theoretical
- Subject of science fiction and philosophical debate

## Current State of AI

Most AI systems today are Narrow AI with Limited Memory capabilities. They excel at specific tasks but cannot generalize their knowledge to other domains without significant retraining.

## Looking Ahead

The field is progressing towards more general and adaptive AI systems, but significant challenges remain in areas like:
- Understanding context and common sense
- Emotional intelligence
- Creative problem-solving
- Ethical decision-making
