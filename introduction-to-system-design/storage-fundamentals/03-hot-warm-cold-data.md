### **Defining Data Temperature**

**Hot Data: The Active Zone**

What Makes Data "Hot":

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Characteristics:

✓Data that is  accessed frequently (daily/hourly)

✓ Data which is modified often

✓ Time-sensitive

✓ Business-critical

✓ Needs low latency

Examples:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1\. In the case of  E-commerce:

   \- Current product inventory

   \- Shopping cart contents

   \- Today's orders

   \- Active user sessions

2\. Social Media:

   \- Recent posts (last 7 days)

   \- Current trending topics

   \- Active user profiles

   \- Real-time notifications

3\. Banking:

   \- Current account balances

   \- Today's transactions

   \- Active credit card sessions

   \- Real-time fraud detection data

Storage Choice:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Ideal: RAM cache \+ SSD

Why: Need instant access

Cost: High ($0.10-0.50/GB/month)

Worth it: Users notice any delay\!

**Warm Data: The Middle Ground**

What Makes Data "Warm":

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Characteristics:

✓ Accessed occasionally (weekly/monthly)

✓ Rarely modified

✓ Still relevant

✓ Not time-critical

✓ Can tolerate slight delay

Examples:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1\. E-commerce:

   \- Order history (last 90 days)

   \- Product reviews

   \- Customer support tickets (recent)

   \- Returns/refunds data

2\. Social Media:

   \- Posts from last month

   \- User activity logs

   \- Analytics data

   \- Older notifications

3\. Banking:

   \- Transaction history (3-6 months)

   \- Archived statements

   \- Historical account data

   \- Completed loan applications

Storage Choice:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


Ideal: HDD or standard SSD

Why: To balance out cost and access

Cost: Moderate ($0.02-0.08/GB/month)

Worth it: Good enough performance

**Cold Data: The Archive**

What Makes Data "Cold":

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Characteristics:

✓ Rarely accessed (yearly or never)

✓ Never modified (immutable)

✓ Historical/compliance

✓ Can wait minutes/hours for access

✓ Needs to be kept (legal/audit)

Examples:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1\. E-commerce:

   \- Orders from 5 years ago

   \- Old product catalogs

   \- Deleted account backups

   \- Compliance audit logs

2\. Social Media:

   \- Deleted posts (retention policy)

   \- User data snapshots

   \- System logs from years ago

   \- Legal discovery data

3\. Banking:

   \- 7-year transaction history

   \- Closed account records

   \- Old audit reports

   \- Regulatory compliance archives

Storage Choice:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Ideal storage: Glacier, tape, cold storage

Why:  Data is rarely accessed, needs to be cheap

Cost: Very low ($0.001-0.004/GB/month)

Worth it: 20x cheaper\! Storage at scale\!

### **Data Temperature Transitions**

The Lifecycle of Data:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Day 1: HOT 🔥

├─ User uploads photo

├─ Stored in: SSD with RAM cache

├─ Access: 1000+ times/day

└─ Cost: $0.10/GB/month

Day 30: WARM 🌤️

├─ Photo is 1 month old

├─ Moved to: Standard storage

├─ Access: 10 times/day

└─ Cost: $0.03/GB/month

Day 365: COLD ❄️

├─ Photo is 1 year old

├─ Moved to: Glacier

├─ Access: 1 time/year (if ever)

└─ Cost: $0.004/GB/month

Day 2555: FROZEN 🧊

├─ Photo is 7 years old

├─ Moved to: Deep archive/tape

├─ Access: Only if subpoenaed

└─ Cost: $0.001/GB/month

**Real-World Example: Instagram**

Instagram Photo Storage Strategy:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

When you upload a photo to instagram

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Day 0-7: HOT 🔥

Location: CDN (remember Amazon Cloudfront from the diagram) \+ SSD cache

Why: 90% of views happen in first week

Access pattern: Thousands of views

Storage: Multiple copies in RAM/SSD

Cost per GB: $0.50/month

User experience: \<50ms load time

Week 2-Month 3: WARM 🌤️

Location: Standard S3 storage

Why: Occasional views from followers

Access pattern: Dozens of views

Storage: Standard redundancy

Cost per GB: $0.023/month

User experience: \~200ms load time

Month 4+: COLD ❄️

Location: S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Why: Rarely viewed old photos

Access pattern: A few views per month

Storage: Automatic tier adjustment

Cost per GB: $0.01/month

User experience: \~500ms first access

Year 2+: FROZEN 🧊

Location: Glacier Deep Archive

Why: Historical archive (almost never viewed)

Access pattern: Almost never

Storage: Tape backup, rare access

Cost per GB: $0.001/month

User experience: 12 hours to retrieve (if ever needed)

Instagram's savings:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1 billion photos uploaded/day

Average photo: 2MB

If ALL photos were to be  stored HOT:

\- 2,000 TB uploaded daily

\- 730,000 TB per year

\- Cost: $365,000/day \= $133M/year 😱

With temperature-based storage:

\- Recent (HOT): 14,000 TB × $0.50 \= $7,000/day

\- Warm: 100,000 TB × $0.023 \= $2,300/day

\- Cold: 616,000 TB × $0.001 \= $616/day

\- Total: $10,000/day \= $3.6M/year ✓

Savings: $129M/year (97% reduction\!)

ed on access patterns

### **The 80/20 Rule in Storage**

Pareto Principle for Data:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Observation:

\- 20% of your data gets 80% of the access

\- 80% of your data gets 20% of the access

Translation:

\- Keep 20% (hot) on expensive fast storage

\- Keep 80% (cold) on cheap slow storage

Real Numbers:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Total data: 100 TB

Naive approach (all hot storage):

\- 100 TB × $0.10/GB \= $10,000/month

Optimized approach:

\- 20 TB hot × $0.10/GB \= $2,000/month

\- 80 TB cold × $0.01/GB \= $800/month

\- Total: $2,800/month

Savings: $7,200/month (72% reduction\!)

Same user experience for 99% of requests\!

### **Decision Framework: Choosing Storage Temperature**

## **🚀 Interview-Ready Summary**

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Storage types serve different purposes** \- Block for performance, File for sharing, Object for scale
2. **Speed costs money** \- RAM is 1000x faster but 100x more expensive than disk
3. **Data has temperature** \- Most data is cold, optimize accordingly
4. **The 80/20 rule** \- 20% of data gets 80% of access
5. **Lifecycle management** \- Automatically move data based on age/access

**When asked "How would you design storage for this system?"**

Answer framework:

1. "First, I'd identify the hot data that needs fast access..."
   * User sessions → RAM cache
   * Active records → SSD database
2. "Then categorize data by access patterns..."
   * Daily access → Hot (SSD \+ cache)
   * Weekly/monthly → Warm (Standard storage)
   * Yearly/never → Cold (Archive)
3. "Choose appropriate storage types..."
   * Database → Block storage
   * Shared files → File storage
   * Media/backups → Object storage
4. "Implement lifecycle policies..."
   * Auto-transition based on age
   * Monitor access patterns
   * Optimize costs continuously
5. "Calculate cost savings..."
   * All hot: $X/month
   * Tiered: $Y/month
   * Savings: $(X-Y)/month

**Common Interview Questions:**

Q: "Why not put everything in RAM?" A: "RAM is volatile (loses data on restart) and expensive. We need persistent storage for data, but use RAM for caching hot data."

Q: "When would you use object storage vs file storage?" A: "Object storage for static assets, backups, and unstructured data at scale. File storage when you need hierarchical organization or multiple servers sharing files."

Q: "How would you optimize storage costs?" A: "Implement data lifecycle policies, cache hot data in RAM/SSD, move warm data to standard storage, archive cold data, and delete expired data. Use the 80/20 rule—keep 20% hot, 80% cold."

**You're now ready to design production storage systems\!** 🎉

Remember: The best storage architecture isn't the fastest or the cheapest—it's the one that matches your access patterns. Fast where it matters, cheap where it doesn't.

Keep practicing by analyzing storage in systems you use daily. Ask yourself: "Why did they choose this storage solution?" That's how you develop storage intuition\!
