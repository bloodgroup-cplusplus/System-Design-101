## **⚙️ 4: CPU Basics \- The Brain in Detail**

### **🎯 Challenge 4: The Restaurant Kitchen**

**Scenario:** You own a restaurant. You need to serve 100 customers per hour.

**Option A:** Hire one incredibly fast chef who cooks 100 meals/hour **Option B:** Hire 10 regular chefs, each cooking 10 meals/hour

**Option C:** Hire 4 chefs, but each works on multiple dishes simultaneously

**Question:** Which is best? What are the trade-offs?

**The Answer:** This is exactly the CPU design problem\! Modern CPUs use a combination of all three approaches.

### **🧠 What is a CPU Core?**

CPU CORE \- The Processing Unit

A core is one independent processing unit:

One core can execute ONE instruction
stream at a time.

### **🔢 Multi-Core CPUs: The Team Approach**

EVOLUTION OF CPUS

📅 YEAR 2000: Single Core

![img21](https://res.cloudinary.com/dretwg3dy/image/upload/v1762356154/38_ffmsoi.png)

Power: 1x
Can do: 1 task at a time

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📅 YEAR 2006: Dual Core

![img22](https://res.cloudinary.com/dretwg3dy/image/upload/v1762354298/26_rmw1oa.png)

Power: 2x (nearly)
Can do: 2 tasks simultaneously

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📅 YEAR 2010: Quad Core

![img23](https://res.cloudinary.com/dretwg3dy/image/upload/v1762354298/27_rx20ty.png)

Power: 4x (nearly)
Can do: 4 tasks simultaneously

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📅 YEAR 2025: Many Cores

![img24](https://res.cloudinary.com/dretwg3dy/image/upload/v1762354298/28_mcqmzg.png)

High-End Desktop: 32 cores
Server CPU: 128+ cores\!

### **🎮 Real-World Example: Gaming**

**Let's see how cores are used while gaming:**

GAME RUNNING ON 8-CORE CPU

Without multiple cores:
One core at 370% \= Impossible\!
Game would run at \<30 FPS

### **⏱️ Clock Speed: How Fast the CPU Thinks**

CLOCK SPEED (GHz \- Gigahertz)

Clock speed \= How many cycles per second

1 Hz \= 1 cycle per second
1 KHz \= 1,000 cycles per second
1 MHz \= 1,000,000 cycles per second
1 GHz \= 1,000,000,000 cycles per second

Modern CPU: 3.5 GHz
\= 3,500,000,000 cycles per second\!

What happens in one cycle?

Simple instruction (add two numbers):
1 cycle \= **Fetch, Decode, Execute, Write**

Complex instruction (divide):
10-50 cycles

Memory access:
100-300 cycles (cache miss)

---

---

### **🎯 Instruction Execution: The CPU Pipeline**

**How does a CPU execute instructions?**

THE 4-STAGE PIPELINE

Classic  pipeline:

**Stage 1: FETCH**
├─ Get instruction from memory
└─ "Retrieve ADD instruction"

**Stage 2: DECODE**
├─ Figure out what instruction means
└─ "ADD: Add two numbers"

**Stage 3: EXECUTE**
├─ Perform the operation
└─ "5 \+ 3 \= 8"

**Stage 4: WRITE BACK**
├─ Write result back
└─ "Register now contains 8"

### **🚨 Common Misconception: "Higher GHz Always Faster"**

**You might think:** "5 GHz CPU must be faster than 3 GHz\!"

**The Reality:** It's more complex\!

❌ NAIVE COMPARISON:

CPU A: 5.0 GHz, 4 cores
CPU B: 3.5 GHz, 8 cores

Your assumption: A is 43% faster\!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ REAL-WORLD RESULTS:

Single-threaded task (video game main thread):

├─ CPU A: 100 FPS  ✓ (Winner\!)

└─ CPU B: 70 FPS

Multi-threaded task (video rendering):

├─ CPU A: 4 min

└─ CPU B: 2.5 min  ✓ (Winner\!)

Why?────────────────────────────────────

Single-threaded: Only one core used

├─ Higher GHz wins

└─ CPU A's 5 GHz beats B's 3.5 GHz

Multi-threaded: All cores used

├─ More cores win

└─ CPU B's 8 cores beat A's 4 cores

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OTHER FACTORS THAT MATTER:

Architecture efficiency:

├─ Instructions per cycle (IPC)

├─ Some CPUs do more per clock

└─ Example: Apple M3 beats Intel at same GHz\!

Cache size:

├─ Larger cache \= fewer RAM accesses

└─ Can matter more than 0.5 GHz\!

Memory speed:

├─ CPU waiting for RAM \= wasted cycles

└─ Fast RAM helps more than high GHz

Power efficiency:

├─ High GHz \= high power \= thermal throttling

└─ Sustained 4 GHz \> burst 5 GHz that throttles

### **🎮 Decision Game: Choose Your CPU**

**Scenario: Pick the best CPU for each task:**

CPU Options:

A. 4 cores,  5.5 GHz, 16 MB cache, $300

B. 8 cores,  4.0 GHz, 32 MB cache, $350

C. 16 cores, 3.0 GHz, 64 MB cache, $500

Tasks:

1\. Gaming (mostly single-threaded)

2\. Video editing (multi-threaded)

3\. 3D rendering (highly parallel)

4\. Office work (light multitasking)

5\. Software development (compiling code)

**Think about each one...**

---

**ANSWERS:**

1\. Gaming → CPU A

   Why: High single-thread performance

   5.5 GHz handles main game thread best

2\. Video editing → CPU B

   Why: Good balance

   8 cores for timeline processing

   4 GHz still decent for playback

3\. 3D rendering → CPU C

   Why: Maximum parallelism

   16 cores render 16 pixels simultaneously

   3 GHz sufficient per thread

4\. Office work → CPU A or B

   Why: Overkill for Office\!

   Even CPU A is excessive

   (Budget option would work fine)

5\. Software development → CPU B

   Why: Balanced

   Compiling uses all cores

   High clock helps IDE responsiveness

   32MB cache helps with large projects
